Faulty Server Proxy

A very creatively named solution project for an interview assignment.
Built using Flask (first time). I always use virtualenvwrapper, so simply create a new env and do:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Expects the required backend service to be running on localhost:8088.

WIP.
